## Installation

If you have Anaconda and the summiting_environment.yml file installed, the following line of code will create an environment with compatible packages for running the analysis pipeline:

```
$ conda env create -f summiting_environment.yml
```




Previous README (to be changed soon!):
This code is a work in progress! It is currently in a usable, but not finished, state for analyzing summiting data. Check back soon for a much better looking README file and better instuctions, as well as revised code.

Current known issues:
- NA (but I'm sure we'll find them!)

If the code doesn't work as expected, please email Julius at jtabin@g.harvard.edu. However, many issues arise because of incorrect formatting of the "survival_data.xlsx" sheet. For instructions on how to do this, please see [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19SRpimdHw6hPUJXM0fsrobkKUc5Ypd8zhV1BmTE9Skg/edit?usp=sharing) and/or [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VW9UR2XYu1eL4U_A--c2y4fPXs1X0GESYP2M_Z2HJwk/edit?usp=sharing)
